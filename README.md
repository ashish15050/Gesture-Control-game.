# Gesture Control Game Using Python
# Overview:
The "Gesture Control Game Using Python" is an interactive game where players use hand gestures to control game elements. This project combines computer vision and machine learning to provide a unique, hands-free gaming experience.

# Objective:
To create a fun and immersive game controlled by hand gestures using a webcam.

# Key Features:
- Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection.
- Gesture Recognition: Recognizes gestures like "thumbs up" to control in-game actions.
- Interactive Gameplay: Players use natural hand movements to interact with the game.

# Technologies Used:
- OpenCV: For video capture and image processing.
- MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- Pygame: For game development and interface creation.

# Implementation Steps: 
1. Capture video and track hands using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
2. Detect specific gestures and map them to game controls.
3. Use Pygame to create the game interface and handle gameplay logic.
